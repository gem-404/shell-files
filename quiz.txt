Hello mathematicians, here is a question.. (A bit related to computer science also)...
Suppose you have an array of numbers, or a set of numbers => {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

These numbers can be positively and absolutely known, by two other distinct numbers, the LCM and their sum.
If one knows the LCM and the Sum of a set of numbers, one can easily determine the set of numbers.

When coding this in python, the problem is that I can't get the correct LCM of the numbers when 
the set or the array has more than 20 elements in it. Are there any two other attributes other 

than sum and LCM of a set of numbers that can give me the absolute elements of the array?

(I have also tried this with packages like numpy)
